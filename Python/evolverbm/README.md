# Gradschool base convrbms for thesis

These are a bunch of scripts that composed the last half of grad school. My thesis was 
based in these.

Several different authors, including myself, Nathan Rude...

It's been so many years since working on these, good luck untangling them. Primarily 
looking for a place to store them so they don't disappear over time! 


Thanks
